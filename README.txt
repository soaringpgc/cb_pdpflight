The is an extension to plugin Cloud Base. This adds the PGC PDP flightlog. 

== Description ==

    After attempting to do it the "easy way" I ran into trouble with conflicts with
    my "flight Metrics" plugin shared function names, scripts and css. So I want back to
    do it the "right" way by using classes and namespaces. I started with a Wordpress
    plugin in boilerplate. Needed to add features to link Shortcodes. (I don't understand
    why that is not part of the normal boilerplate  and localize scripts.)
    
    At this point I have the flight log working. Or at least as well as it was working with
    out the boilerplate template.
    
    The core function of this is from PGC PDP flight log system that was written in 2010
    using DreamWeaver. It was converted from PHP 5.4 to 7.6. The code you see in the /Views
    foler was generated from DreamWeaver. (don't blame me.)



*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
*   "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.
